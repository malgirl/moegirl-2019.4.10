The player's real journey starts here and the world itself is home to a variety of mummy zombies. There are 35 levels in this world, 7 plants to be obtained and 15 zombies to fight against. \nAncient Egypt does not have a game description on when the event took place in the timeline, unlike the other ten worlds. It is assumed that it is approximately between 3100 BC to 332 BC. However, when Penny and Crazy Dave arrived, Penny said that Crazy Dave should wait 4500 years for his taco, which he ate in 2013. Therefore, they have arrived around 2495 BC, well into the start of the Fifth Dynasty of Egypt (2494 to 2345 BC). \nIn this world, the lawn functions exactly as it normally would on a daytime level from the original Plants vs. Zombies. The main difference here is that tombstones spawn in at the start of the levels (just like night levels from Plants vs. Zombies, except that it is considered daytime with sun dropping from the sky). \n\n\n== \u65f6\u7a7a\u7279\u70b9 ==\n\uff08\u5f85\u8865\u5168\uff09\n\n== \u653b\u7565 ==\n(\u5f85\u8865\u5168\uff09\n\n== \u8ff7\u4f60\u6e38\u620f\uff0b\u6311\u6218 ==\n\n== \u4e0a\u53e4\u57c3\u53ca\u76f8\u5173 =="}}}
