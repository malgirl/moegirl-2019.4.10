''ParameterName''<sup>\u2020</sup>\n! Description and usage notes\n|-\n! <code>EpisodeNumber</code>\n| The episode's number in the series, generally following the order of airing or release. This parameter also creates a link anchor, prefixed by \"ep\"; this allows links to point directly to a given episode: {{para|EpisodeNumber|01}} would allow the link {{nowrap|<code><nowiki>[[List of episodes#ep01]]</nowiki></code>}}.\n|-\n! <code>EpisodeNumber2</code> <small>(optional)</small>\n| A second episode number column. Useful for when a series aired in a different order, or only included certain episodes, etc (for instance, [[List of Sailor Moon episodes (season 1)|season 1]] of ''Sailor Moon'' had several episodes cut when it aired in English).\n|-\n! <code>EnglishTitle</code><sup>\u2021</sup>\n|  The official English title of the episode. If there is no official title (e.g. the series has not been licensed in English, or no official English title has been published), the provided title should be a literal English translation of the Japanese title. <code>EnglishTitle</code> is displayed above <code>RomajiTitle</code> with \"quotes\".\n|-\n! <code>KanjiTitle</code><sup>\u2021</sup>\n| The [[kanji]] episode title (for example, \"\u6f02\u6d41? \u5192\u967a\u306e\u5cf6\"). This displays in parenthesis after <code>RomajiTitle</code>.\n\nNote that some browsers may not properly display kanji, or some computers may not have proper fonts installed, resulting in square boxes or question marks displaying instead of the actual kanji characters - see [[Help:Multilingual support (East Asian)]] for more information and links to CJK fonts.\n|-\n! <code>RomajiTitle</code><sup>\u2021</sup>\n| The [[Romanization of Japanese|transliterated]] (romaji) Japanese episode title. The title is automatically displayed with ''\"italics and quotes\"''.\n|-\n! <code>RTitle</code> <small>(optional)</small>\n| An unformatted parameter normally used to add a secondary English title, for instance if the same episode had more than one official English release under multiple names (e.g. the first 144 episodes of [[List of One Piece episodes|''One Piece'']]). It can also be used to insert a reference immediately after <code>EnglishTitle</code>.\n\nNote that this outputs immediately after <code>EnglishTitle</code> (there's not even a space between them), so if it's being used to provide a second official English title, a space must be hard-coded in the parameter with <code>&amp;nbsp;</code> or <code>&amp;#32;</code>.\n|-\n! <code>Aux1</code> <small>(optional)</small>\n| A custom-use parameter whose meaning is specified by the table header.\n|-\n! <code>DirectedBy</code> <small>(optional)</small>\n| The individual who directed the episode, or the [[animation director]]. This should be used only when a series was directed by multiple people, with a different person directing each episode, for instance [[List of Samurai Harem: Asu no Yoichi episodes|''Samurai Harem: Asu no Yoichi'']]. It should not be used if just a small handful of the total number of episodes was directed by someone other than the main director.\n|-\n! <code>WrittenBy</code> <small>(optional)</small>\n| The individual who wrote the episode ([[screenplay]]). This should only be used when a series was written by multiple people, with a different person writing each episode, for instance [[List of Buso Renkin episodes|''Buso Renkin'']]. It should not be used if just a small handful of the total number of episodes was written by someone other than the main writer.\n|-\n! <code>Aux2</code> and <code>Aux3</code> <small>(optional)</small>\n| Custom-use parameters whose meanings are specified by the table header.\n|-\n! <code>OriginalAirDate</code>\n| The date the episode first aired on TV in Japan. For [[original net animation]]s, this should be the date the episode was first streamed online, and for [[original video animation]]s, can be used for the date the episode was first released on [[VHS]], [[DVD]], [[Blu-ray Disc]], etc. Use {{Tl|Start date}}.\n|-\n! <code>FirstEngAirDate</code> <small>(optional)</small>\n| The date the English-dubbed/subtitled episode was first aired on television or streamed online (release dates of fandubs or fansubs should not be listed here, and will be removed on site). It is assumed that this refers to a traditional dubbed television broadcast; if the episode is subbed, streamed online, or both, a note should be placed in the lead.\n\nIf a series is licensed in English, but a given episode has no official English airdate, an mdash (\u2014) should be used. The field should not contain TBA/TBD/TBR (to be announced/determined/revealed) etc, and it should not be left blank.\n|-\n! <code>ProdCode</code> <small>(optional)</small>\n| The episode's production code. This field should only be used when a series' production codes do not match its episode numbers for some reason, and an explanation of the discrepancy should be provided in the lead, if it can be reliably sourced. When defined, this parameter also creates a link anchor, prefixed by \"pc\"; this allows links to point directly to a given episode: {{para|ProdCode|01}} would allow the link {{nowrap|<code><nowiki>[[List of episodes#pc01]]</nowiki></code>}}.\n|-\n! <code>Aux4</code> <small>(optional)</small>\n| A custom-use parameter whose meaning is specified by the table header.\n|-\n! <code>ShortSummary</code> <small>(optional)</small>\n| A succinct summary of the episode. Episode summaries cannot be copied from websites, program guides, or other sources; these will be removed as [[Wikipedia:Copyright violations|copyright violations]]. [[Wikipedia:Spoiler|Spoilers should not be avoided]] in summaries unless an episode has not been aired or released yet, in which case it is generally preferable to completely omit the summary until the episode airs.\n\nIf <code>ShortSummary</code> is defined but empty, an empty \"placeholder\" cell will be displayed. This is useful if a custom <code>LineColor</code> is being used, but no one has written a summary for a given episode.\n|-\n! <code>LineColor<code> <small>(optional)</small>\n| The color of the line separating episode entries, in [[Web colors#Hex triplet|hex triplets]]. The number sign (#) is inserted automatically, so <code>#009900</code>, for example, would be input as {{para|LineColor|009900}} (or the shorthand {{para|LineColor|090}}). <code>LineColor</code> defaults to <span style=\"background: #CCF;\">#CCF</span>, and custom <code>LineColor</code> values are ignored if <code>ShortSummary</code> is undefined.\n|-\n! <code>TopColor</code> <small>(optional)</small>\n| The color of the main row of information (<code>EpisodeNumber</code>, <code><sub>''x''</sub>Title</code>, <code><sub>''x''</sub>AirDate</code>, etc). If <code>ShortSummary</code> is defined, this defaults to <span style=\"background: #F2F2F2;\">#F2F2F2</span>; otherwise, it defaults to the table default.\n|}\n\n; Notes\n* \u2020 - Any field (except <code>LineColor</code> and <code>TopColor</code>) will display an empty cell if it is defined but empty.\n* \u2021 - At least one of <code>EnglishTitle</code>, <code>KanjiTitle</code>, or <code>RomajiTitle</code> must be defined.\n \n\nThis shows how the template appears with all parameters defined ({{para|LineColor}} and {{para|TopColor}} are not shown, since they don't output text):\n<table class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"width: 98%; white-space: nowrap;\">\n{{\u52a8\u753b\u4f5c\u54c1\u5267\u60c5\u6a21\u677f\n| EpisodeNumber   = <nowiki>{{{EpisodeNumber}}}</nowiki>\n| EpisodeNumber2  = <nowiki>{{{EpisodeNumber2}}}</nowiki>\n| EnglishTitle    = <nowiki>{{{EnglishTitle}}}</nowiki>\n| KanjiTitle      = <nowiki>{{{KanjiTitle}}}</nowiki>\n| RomajiTitle     = <nowiki>{{{RomajiTitle}}}</nowiki>\n| RTitle          = <nowiki>{{{RTitle}}}</nowiki>\n| Aux1            = <nowiki>{{{Aux1}}}</nowiki>\n| DirectedBy      = <nowiki>{{{DirectedBy}}}</nowiki>\n| WrittenBy       = <nowiki>{{{WrittenBy}}}</nowiki>\n| Aux2            = <nowiki>{{{Aux2}}}</nowiki>\n| Aux3            = <nowiki>{{{Aux3}}}</nowiki>\n| OriginalAirDate = <nowiki>{{{OriginalAirDate}}}</nowiki>\n| FirstEngAirDate = <nowiki>{{{FirstEngAirDate}}}</nowiki>\n| ProdCode        = <nowiki>{{{ProdCode}}}</nowiki>\n| Aux4            = <nowiki>{{{Aux4}}}</nowiki>\n| ShortSummary    = <nowiki>{{{ShortSummary}}}</nowiki>\n}}\n</table>\n\n\u8303\u4f8b\uff1a\n<table class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width: 98%;\" border=\"1\">\n{{\u52a8\u753b\u4f5c\u54c1\u5267\u60c5\u6a21\u677f\n| EpisodeNumber   = 1\n| EnglishTitle    = The Adventures of Mikuru Asahina Episode 00\n| KanjiTitle      = \u671d\u6bd4\u5948\u30df\u30af\u30eb\u306e\u5192\u967a Episode00\n| RomajiTitle     = Asahina Mikuru no B\u014dken Episode 00\n| OriginalAirDate = 2006.04.02\n| ShortSummary    = The SOS Brigade previews their movie of questionable quality.
