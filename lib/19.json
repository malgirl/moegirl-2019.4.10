God kills a kitten\u7684\u56de\u8986\u96fb\u90f5\uff1a\n\nThanks for your interest in killing kittens, Chris. Yes, it\u2019s true, that popular phrasing (of an old Catholic school joke) was originated by me, and immortalized in the pages of the first issue of BarFly Magazine, which came out in May 1999. It was one of the things that put BarFly on the map! It became an immediate fixture on fridges and backbars in Portland, and several people photocopied it, made stickers (including someone who re-set the type, misspelling masturbate, but leaving the BarFly tag on it, much to my chagrin), and variously disseminated it throughout Portland, and then, the rest of the world.\n\nThat image is the same as the one that appeared in the first issue of BarFly, except somone whited out our logo, which appeared to the left of \u201cthink about it\u201d. I\u2019ll send you a scan of the original page, when I\u2019m back in office, later today.\n\nPlease let me know if you have any further questions.\n\nYour pal,\n\nJen Lane\nBarFly\n\n[[Category:\u6742\u6587]]"}}}
